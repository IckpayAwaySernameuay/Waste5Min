Hi! Thanks for trying my program I'm not really good at programming yet so this is how I have to make them.

To run my program do the following:
Make sure your computer is running Windows (If you dont know what that is if your computer has an apple on it than you dont have it.)
Download the latest python beginning with a 3 (Ex: 3.x.x) from www.python.org
Download that.
When you download it make sure to check a button called add to path or something of the sort
	If you forget to do that run the program again
Hit the start button or go to the search bar
Type "Command Prompt" (excludion quotations)
When it opens type
	python (drag the thing title Animals here)
Hit enter.
